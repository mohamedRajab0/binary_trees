# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

This repository contains my solutions to the "0x1D. C - Binary trees" project, which is part of the low-level programming track at Holberton School.

## Description

In this project, I explored the concept of binary trees in the C programming language. I implemented various binary tree data structures and algorithms to manipulate and traverse binary trees efficiently. The project covers topics such as binary tree traversal methods (pre-order, in-order, post-order), tree height calculation, tree balancing, and more.

## Project Tasks

The project tasks cover a range of concepts related to binary trees, including:

- Binary tree data structure implementation
- Binary tree traversal algorithms
- Binary tree height calculation
- Binary tree balancing algorithms (AVL trees)
- Binary tree search algorithms (BST)

## Requirements

The project is coded in C language. The code is compiled using GCC and follows the [Betty style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) guide.


## Usage

To compile the files, use the following command:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o binary_trees
```

Then, to run the compiled program:

```
./binary_trees
```
